          <h2>Freedom Fighter of India</h2>
          <p>
           <b><span>S</span>ubhas Chandra Bose </b>  (1897â€“1945) was a prominent Indian nationalist leader known for his fervent efforts to free India from British rule. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, Bose was deeply influenced by the ideals of patriotism and independence from a young age. He pursued higher education in England, where he became involved in nationalist politics.

          Bose joined the Indian National Congress and rose to prominence within the party, serving as its president in 1938. However, he resigned due to ideological differences and founded the Forward Bloc. His advocacy for complete independence and opposition to British colonialism marked him as a fierce nationalist leader.

          During World War II, Bose sought international support for India's independence and eventually sought assistance from Axis powers, including Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. He organized the Indian National Army (INA) to fight alongside Japanese forces against the British in Southeast Asia.

          Bose's death in 1945 remains shrouded in mystery, with conflicting accounts about the circumstances. Despite his untimely demise, his legacy as a fearless freedom fighter and visionary leader endures in India's struggle for independence. Subhas Chandra Bose remains an iconic figure in Indian history, revered for his unwavering commitment to liberating India from colonial rule.
